# Introduction

## Why?

I want to improvise my overall programming throughout different languages as well as actively use my problem solving skills in order to achieve the biggest brain possible (This is a lie, I just want to be able to pass technical interviews).

## How does it work?

I will be attempting to complete the Blind 75 Leetcode roadmap. Throughout doing so, I will attempt to do best and in that case do my other best in producing the best overall performance regarding the code.

If I solve the problem but the time complexity is _poor_, then I will re-do it to achieve a better result however all solutions will be saved.

I will also attempt to achieve each problem using&#x20;

* Python
* Golang
* Java&#x20;
* (possibly Typescript too, we'll see).
